            <h3>How do I place an order for custom merchandise?</h3>
            To place an order for custom merchandise, follow these simple steps:

            To place an order for custom merchandise, simply browse our website and select the desired product category. Then, click on the "Add to Cart" button for the items you wish to order. Once you've added all your desired items to the cart, proceed to the checkout page.

We will then reach out to you within 24 hours to further discuss your order and provide you with a quote.

            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Can I preview my design before placing an order?</h3>
            Since our customization process is based on individual requests, we don't offer a real-time design preview. However, you can describe your design preferences in the "Additional Comments" section during checkout, and our team will work closely with you to ensure your custom merchandise meets your expectations. We will also send you a design proof before starting production.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>What file formats do you accept for custom artwork?</h3>
            We accept various file formats for custom artwork, including JPEG, PNG, PDF, and AI (Adobe Illustrator). You can email your artwork or design files to us after submitting your order. Please ensure that your files meet our requirements for optimal printing quality.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>How long does it take to process and ship my order?</h3>
            The processing time for custom merchandise orders depends on the specific product and the complexity of customization. Typically, it takes 3-7 business days for our team to process and prepare your order for shipping. After processing, the estimated shipping time will vary based on your location. You will receive a confirmation email with tracking details once your order is shipped.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Can I cancel or modify my order after it has been placed?</h3>
            We understand that circumstances may change. If you need to cancel or modify your order, please contact our customer support team as soon as possible. We will do our best to accommodate your request, but please note that order modifications or cancellations may not be possible if the production process has already begun.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
            We accept various payment methods, including credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), PayPal, and other secure online payment options. Rest assured that all transactions are processed securely to protect your sensitive information.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>What is your return and refund policy?</h3>
            Please note that custom orders are non-returnable and non-refundable once they have been approved, and production has begun. These orders are specifically tailored to your unique requirements, making them ineligible for returns or refunds. We are committed to working closely with you to ensure your complete satisfaction with your custom merchandise.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Do you offer bulk or wholesale discounts?</h3>
